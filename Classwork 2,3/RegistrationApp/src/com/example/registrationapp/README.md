Simple User Registration and Storage
This project is a Java Swing application that lets you easily register user details (like name, mobile, address, etc.) through a graphical form. Once you hit 'register,' that information is saved into a lightweight SQLite database. The cool part? All those registered users are then immediately displayed in a table within the same application window, giving you an instant overview of your data.
Think of it as a small, self-contained system for collecting and viewing basic user information right on your desktop, with all data managed locally in a file.
